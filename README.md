An application that is meant to both look and behave like a calculator.

JavaScript Plan

The top display value will store a string so that number can be easily added to the back but will be converted to a int when math is used in the function.

When a sign button is used the current value and the used button will be stored in a object and since we aren't wondering about bedmas when another button is used the current value as well as the stored button and old values will be used to find the current value so that can be stored in the same object as the old value along with the old button or out output to the outpur area.

All memory button will simplily add minus and get the stored value from a varible.

!!!IMPORTANT NOTE
CAN'T STORE NUMBERS HIGHER THAN 10 \*\* 20
